# 1- OpenThread Border Router setup for Matter Development

## Summary ##
{% include list.liquid all=true %}

**Written on November 29th 2021**
**Built on Ubuntu Server for Raspberry 20.04 LTS3**

## Purpose of this guide ##
This guide aims to help devloppers get started with Matter developement

It provides guidance on how to build and run an OpenThread Border Router from scratch on a Raspberry Pi 4 that supports Matter operations

Because Matter is still under development, this guide stands aside from the usual Simplicity Studio approach

Silicon Labs still aims to integrating Matter in the Gecko SDK Suite at some point

Therefore this guide applies only if:
* You wish to start Matter Alpha development 
* You are looking for a non Simplicity Studio way of building the Border Router

For a more standard or OpenThread Only approach Silicon Labs has defined a developer friendly environement

You can follow [AN1256](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1256-using-sl-rcp-with-openthread-border-router.pdf) for that purpose

## Need Help ? ##

The only one place to request for help on building a border router will be [**Silicon Labs Community**](https://community.silabs.com/)

There is a dedicated section for [Thread](https://community.silabs.com/s/topic/0TO1M000000qHbcWAE/thread?language=en_US) in which you can ask community users for help

You can also find a non technical Matter Introduction and FAQ on [this Community article](https://community.silabs.com/s/question/0D58Y00008AV6hSSAT/what-is-matter-smart-home-standard-answers-to-10-frequently-asked-questions?language=en_US)
