# Add the Python Controller to this Border Router instance

## Building the Python Controller

This can simply be achieved by creating a Matter dev environment from [this guide]({{ site.github.url }}/OpenThread/Applications/Matter_development_setup/)

And then build the Python Controller from [this guide]({{ site.github.url }}/OpenThread/Applications/CHIP_use_python_controller/)

## Commission nodes using the Python Controller

This is going to be detailed in the sample app procedures such as [here for lighting app]({{ site.github.url }}/OpenThread/Applications/CHIP_compile_lighting_example/commision_and_test.html)

But can still be found in the Python Controller [usage guide]({{ site.github.url }}/OpenThread/Applications/CHIP_use_python_controller/commision_and_test.html)
